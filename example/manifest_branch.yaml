# Version specifies which version is being being branched
# This is use for `--version`, metrics, and determining proxy capabilities.
# Note that since this determines proxy capabilities, it is desirable to follow Istio semver
version: 1.8.0

# Some of the artifacts have a docker hub built in - currently this is the operator and Helm charts
# The specified docker hub will be used there. Note - this does not effect where the images are published,
# but if the images are not later published to this hub the charts will not pull a valid image
docker: docker.io/istio

# Directory specifies the working directory to build in
directory: /tmp/istio-release

# Dependencies specifies dependencies of the build
# Note - only istio
# Other dependencies are only required to grab licenses and publish tags to Github.
# Fields:
#   localpath: rather than pull from git, copy a local git repository
#
#   git: specifies the git source to pull from
#     branch: branch to pull from git
#     sha: sha to pull from git
#     auto: rather than a static branch/sha, determine the sha to use from istio/istio.
#           possible values are `deps` to check istio.deps, and `modules` to check go.mod
